## 🧭 Alternatives & Similar Tools

When I started building CommiZard, I made sure to look around — and guess what?

> CommiZard isn’t the only wizard in town! 😊

If you’re exploring AI-powered commit tools, here are some other great projects
worth checking out:

- **[easycommit](https://github.com/blackironj/easycommit)** — written in Go,
  supports Ollama models out of the box.
- **[aicommit](https://github.com/suenot/aicommit)** — Packed with features —
  including a handy VS Code extension.
- **[AICommit2](https://github.com/tak-bro/aicommit2)** — The most complete FOSS
  option I've found

> *Why did I still follow through and build this?*
>
> Because I couldn’t find a tool that gave me both full user control and the
> little UX comforts I wanted.
>
> So yeah — I built CommiZard for me… and maybe for you too 😉
