# How to Contribute to CommiZard

Thank you for your interest in helping shape CommiZard! I’m this in my free
time, so your help means the world.

Here are some ways you can help improve this project:

---

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs / Requesting Features

1. Check if it’s already reported — search [open issues](...).
2. If it’s new → [open an issue](...)!
    - Be as detailed as you can: OS, Python version, steps to reproduce,
      expected vs actual behavior.
    - For feature requests → describe your use case! Why do you need it?

> [!TIP]
> The clearer your report, the faster we can fix or build it!

---

## ️ Pull Requests (Code Contributions)

1. Fork the repo → clone your fork.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-feature-or-fix`
3. Code your fix/feature — try to match existing style.
4. Write a clear commit message (ironic, right? 😄).
5. Push to your fork → open a PR against `master`.

✅ I’ll review it as soon as I can!  
✅ Even small fixes (typos, docs, tests) are welcome!

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

Right now, tests are… minimal. If you want to help add unit/integration tests —
you’ll be my hero.

## Starter Tasks

Not ready to write core features? No problem! These “behind-the-scenes” tasks
are **incredibly valuable**:

- ✍️ **Improve documentation** — Fix typos, clarify confusing sections, add
  examples to README or docstrings.
- **Add or improve tests** — Even one test case helps! We’re starting from
  near-zero. If you know pytest, you're a gem.
- **Test on different versions** — Does it work on Python 3.8? 3.10? What
  about different versions of key dependencies (like `ollama`, `pyperclip`,
  `git`)? Report your setup + results!
- 🧩 **Tidy up code style** — Run `black` or `isort` and send a cleanup
  PR (check with me first if making bulk changes).
- 🔗 **Fix broken links or badges** — In README, docs, etc.
- **Improve this CONTRIBUTING.md file** — Make it clearer? More welcoming? Go
  for it!
- 🖼️ **Add example screenshots or asciinema recordings** — Show CommiZard in
  action!
- 🧹 **Run linters & report issues** — Try running `ruff`, `flake8`, `mypy`or
  `pylint` on the codebase. Found warnings or style inconsistencies? Open an
  issue (or better yet — fix them in a PR!).

> 💬 Even just asking questions — like “How does this part work?” or “Why is it
> built this way?” — can be super helpful. Sometimes explaining it reveals
> better ways to do it!

Need guidance? Just comment on an issue (or open one) saying *“I’d like to help
with this!”* — I’ll happily walk you through it

Whether you’re reporting a typo or sending a PR — you’re helping more than you
